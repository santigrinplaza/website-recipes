    <h1>Description</h1>

<p><strong>Ñoquis</strong> are a beloved dish that brings comfort with every bite. Originating from <em><strong>Italy</strong></em>, this Latin American version is made primarily from <strong>mashed potatoes</strong> mixed with flour, egg, and a bit of salt to create a <em>soft dough</em>. The dough is then shaped into small logs, cut into bite-sized pieces, and sometimes pressed with a fork to form <strong>ridges</strong>. These ridges help sauces adhere to the ñoquis, making each bite full of flavor. The gentle, pillowy texture of the gnocchi melts in your mouth, offering a warm, satisfying experience.</p>

<p>Once cooked in boiling water, the ñoquis float to the surface, signaling that they're ready to be served. They are often sautéed in butter for a <em>golden finish</em> and garnished with fresh herbs such as basil or sage for added flavor. Though the dish can be paired with a variety of sauces, it’s traditionally enjoyed with a simple butter sauce, allowing the ñoquis to shine as the main star. Perfect for family meals or special occasions, ñoquis offer a delightful and versatile way to enjoy the simple yet rich taste of potatoes.</p>

<h1>Ingridients</h1>

        <ul>

                <li>2 lbs (900g) potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter (for serving)</li>
                <li>Fresh basil or sage leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>





        </ul>



        <h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

        <li>Boil the potatoes: Place the peeled and chopped potatoes in a large pot of water and cook until soft (about 15-20 minutes). Drain the potatoes and mash them until smooth, allowing them to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Make the dough: On a clean surface, combine the mashed potatoes, flour, egg, salt, and optional nutmeg or Parmesan cheese. Knead gently until a soft dough forms, being careful not to overwork it.</li>
        <li>Shape the ñoquis: Divide the dough into small portions. Roll each portion into a long log (about 1/2 inch thick), then cut them into small pieces (about 1-inch long). You can use a fork to gently press down on each piece, creating the classic ridges.</li>
        <li>Boil the ñoquis: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the ñoquis into the boiling water in batches. Once they float to the surface (in about 2-3 minutes), remove them with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Serve the ñoquis: In a pan, melt butter over medium heat and sauté the ñoquis for a minute or two until they’re slightly golden. Optionally, garnish with fresh basil or sage leaves.</li>
