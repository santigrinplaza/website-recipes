    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p><strong>Pastel de Papa</strong> is a comforting and hearty dish from Latin American cuisine, particularly popular in <strong><em>Chile and Argentina</em></strong>. It’s essentially a savory casserole made with layers of creamy mashed potatoes, ground meat, and onions. The filling typically combines beef or a mixture of beef and pork, seasoned with garlic, paprika, and cumin to infuse it with rich flavors. Some variations also include olives, hard-boiled eggs, and raisins, adding a delightful contrast in taste and texture. The mashed potatoes are prepared with butter, milk, and sometimes cheese, creating a smooth, velvety base that balances the savory filling. </p>
    <p>To assemble the <strong>pastel de papa</strong>, a layer of mashed potatoes is spread in a baking dish, followed by the seasoned meat mixture. Another layer of mashed potatoes tops the filling, and the casserole is baked until golden brown and crispy on top. The result is a comforting, satisfying dish that can be served as a main course or a side. Whether enjoyed on a special occasion or as a simple family meal, pastel de papa offers a perfect combination of flavors and textures, making it a beloved dish in many homes across Latin America.</p>
