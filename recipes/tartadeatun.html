    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p><strong>Tarta de Atún</strong> is a savory, delicious dish popular in many <em><strong>Latin American countries</strong></em>, especially Argentina. It's a simple yet flavorful tuna pie made with a buttery, flaky <em>crust</em> that holds a filling of canned tuna, onions, eggs, and often a combination of cheese and herbs. The tuna provides a light, delicate flavor that pairs perfectly with the creamy richness of the filling. The pie is easy to assemble and offers a wonderful balance of textures, with the crisp crust contrasting against the smooth, savory filling. Some variations may also include olives, capers, or a touch of paprika, adding extra depth to the dish.</p>
    <p>Once assembled, the tarta is baked until golden brown, resulting in a warm, satisfying meal that can be enjoyed hot or cold. Perfect for a quick lunch, picnic, or dinner, tarta de atún is a versatile dish that can be served with a side salad or enjoyed on its own. Its simplicity and ease of preparation make it a <em>go-to comfort</em> food in many households, and its rich flavor makes it a favorite for gatherings and celebrations. Whether you're using fresh or pantry ingredients, <strong>tarta de atún</strong> is a reliable and tasty option for any occasion.</p>

            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise or sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or a mix)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for sautéing the onion)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
            <li>Olives or capers (optional)</li>




</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>

        <li>Preheat the oven: Set the oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a pie dish if not using a store-bought crust.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Mix the filling: In a bowl, combine the drained tuna, sautéed onions, beaten eggs, mayonnaise or sour cream, grated cheese, and optional parsley. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste.</li>
        <li>Assemble the tarta: Roll out the pie crust and fit it into the prepared pie dish. Pour the tuna filling into the crust, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake the tarta: Place the pie in the oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden and the filling is set.</li>
        <li>Serve: Let the tarta cool slightly before serving. Optionally, garnish with olives or capers for extra flavor.</li>
